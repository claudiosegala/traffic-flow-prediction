Traffic flow prediction is a complex task. It has many challenging factors like scalability, flow oscillation, and external factors. The literature focus on highways and freeways which doesn't have obstructions. This monography focus on road crossings, that have obstructions. To solve the problem, four machine learning techniques were tested. All the techniques chosen were being used on highways and freeways. Two of the techniques are deep learning, \acrfull{LSTM}, and \acrfull{GRU},  and two are traditional, \acrfull{SVM}, and \acrfull{RF}. The results of the experiment were promising. And, all techniques performed better than the proposed baselines. Also, the traditional models stood out against the deep learning techniques tried. On precision, the models guessed if the flow would go up or down around 70\% of the time.
